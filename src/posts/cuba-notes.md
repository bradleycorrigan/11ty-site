**Note** 
I didn’t manage to stick to taking daily notes on each night, so here’s my best effort run down of what happened each day retrospectively.

# Monday 28 April 
Despite everything Americans and the world throw at them, their spirit is so high and their vibes are so on point. Fuel shortages have made blackouts a daily reality, we’ve had around four in less than 48 hours - lasting seemingly completely random amounts of time, but they just get on with it. In fact, the electricity was out when we arrived at camp. 

Tonight, there’s been a blackout pretty much all night but that hasn’t stopped anyone from having the best nights. The band came prepared with a small generator, and kept going. Torches, rum, and good vibes kept things going. Even writing this there’s no electricity. There’s no doubt that this fuel shortage is completely constructed by the American blockade, and is a direct result of it. The blockade stops Cuba from having the fuel it needs to make electricity, but it also stops them from accessing the raw materials they’d need to make a greener grid. Despite that, they continue to survive, and stay positive. 

We spent this day on camp which was really great, it helped us to recover and acclimatise a little after a long day of travelling. We met the other brigades, including the Latin American delegations which were staying at a different camp. Everyone did chants and had their flags out, it was beautiful. The Ghanaians and Colombians did the best chants imo. 

We went to a lecture on the role of the Cuban youth and the challenge of the spread of dis and misinformation from the US hoping to turn the Cuban youth against the revolutionary government. We learned about Project Genesis - multiple operations by the CIA to overthrow the US government. US would attempt to recruit counter revolutionaries by giving them full ride scholarships to US universities and train them to be counter revolutionaries. With the hopes of creating a US backed counter revolutionary movement and overthrow the communist government. This did not work and the counter revolutionaries they recruited were actually committed to the revolution, and later exposed the US on live TV. The person giving the lecture was one of the people who made this denouncement on live Cuban TV. Raul Capote. Raul also said:
> I believe we’ve never been in such danger as we are today 

In reference to US interference and social media war

Tonight was Cuban night, we had a little boogie - ate great food (the pork was amazing) and got a little drunk, and had a great time - all without any electricity other than the small generator the band had. 

None of this could happen without the solidarity of the Cuban people, and of the brigadistas at camp - it would be so easy to fall into anger, upset, and blame the state for the lack of electricity — and that’s exactly what the US wants. But they’ve failed for 60 years to get it. How does such a small island - in the face of an increasingly hostile US administration - keep their cool, and keep going? 
# Tuesday 29 April
There was a power outage again this morning, and for most of the night, I think the electricity was only really working from around 0200-0500. Once again, the Cubans and the brigadistas showed their resilience and their ability to overcome things. The camp started playing bad bunny halfway through me writing that sentence and so I went to dance, I also lost my toothbrush that night somehow. I think I left it outside the bathroom and then it went missing. Since then, I’ve also lost my water bottle which is sad because it was actually Zev’s. (I did actually find the water bottle later, yay. I did not however find my toothbrush)

On this day, we visited a university and learned a little about the education system in Cuba (and one of the students gave us a magic show, which was unexpected, and very sweet.) Primarily, we learnt that education in Cuba is completely free and universal, in Cuba - education is a right that isn’t merely afforded to those well off enough to afford it, or those willing to go into lifelong debt for a degree. 

We also visited a polyclinic today, which is the Cuban form of primary care, essentially a GP practice and a walk in centre in one. The polyclinics also have small wards and ICUs, so definitely a wider remit than a British GP. After visiting both a university and polyclinic today, we started to understand the emphasis the Cubans place on education and healthcare - and the role of both of these things in their internationalism. For example, how they sponsor Palestinian students to attend the Latin American School of Medicine. 

Cuba sends Doctors to other countries, either for a fee, or for free, dependent on the receiving country’s ability to pay. This approach, developed in Fidel’s time as president has helped countless people. Cuban doctors helped more than 50k Venezuelans with cataracts in return for oil subsidies from Chavez. This brought Castro great respect across Latin America and gave him the means to ensure Cubans could continue to exist while America’s illegal blockade tightened. 

We also had international night at the camp that evening, where each country shared food, union merch, literature, and a performance from their country. It was really fun (and also entirely nerve wracking), it went down really well, particularly the various sweet treats from the UK.


Healthcare particularly is a huge point of pride for the Cuban people, every neighbourhood has a doctor and they place a big focus on primary care and preventative approaches. We also learnt that they take a community based approach to treating HIV and that the approach for HIV care is largely primary care driven.  Cuba has the most progressive policies in Latin America and Trans healthcare is fully provided by the state free of charge and includes gender affirming healthcare. A person must have lived in their ‘new’ gender for two years before they can access some types of gender affirming healthcare though. 
# Wednesday 30 April 
Today we visited workplaces - we visited a railway depot. We had a few RMT, ASLEF, and TSSA members in our delegation (and a few people who were just straight up public transport enthusiasts, like me. )

The trains were really cool, and had loads of leg room compared to British trains. I think the carriages were Chinese. Then they gave us coconuts. They spoke to us about how many staff they have on trains (a lot), including two drivers, and at least one member of staff for each carriage. 

The blockade makes it difficult for Cuba to import the raw materials necessary to build new infrastructure, but it also makes it hard for them to make the money needed to improve infrastructure. They’re very limited on who they can trade with, they’re not a naturally resource rich island, and they’re still feeling the impacts of COVID on their tourism industry (a large source of income), as well as the continued impact of Biden’s inaction and Trump/Rubio’s tightening of restrictions on Cuba.

In the afternoon we went to a cinema (very nice vibes, huge auditorium and sort’ve chic Brutalist vibes) to screen some Belly of the Beast documentaries. One was about Cuba’s ‘miracle drops’, a new drug that help them combat dementia, it can slow down the impacts of the disease massively, and even seems to ‘pause’ them entirely for people who are in the earlier stages of dementia related decline. 

# Thursday 1 May 
We woke up super early, like 1am to be up early enough to go to the May Day parade in Havana. There was lots of security and it took a while to get through but it was worth it. Watching the sun rise over Placa de la Revolucion is a beautiful, once in a lifetime experience - as is watching the inspirational May Day parade, with thousands of Cubans taking part with pride. Some held intricate models representing their work, like a plane and a signalling tower, or a vaccine vial, and even a cigar. Of course, it’s important that this all took place on the backdrop of severe shortages and blackouts, perhaps some of the worst that the country has ever had to endure.  

In the afternoon we got to spend some free time in Havana. We explored the old town, and the national hotel, and just walked around quite a bit. Havana is a gorgeous city, but it was very quiet - at least on the tourist front. It’s easy to imagine Havana as a bustling city, it has all the trademarks of an incredibly successful city. I hope that one day Havana, and wider Cuba is able to reach its full potential. It would be amazing to see a busy, bustling capital city with an integrated public transport system carrying tourists and citizens alike from one place to another. 

We also saw the Granma! The boat that carried 82 fighters from Cuba to Mexico to overthrow the Batista regime. Seeing the boat in real life really makes you wonder how on earth they possibly fit 82 people on there. It’s such a nondescript small yacht that you’d never immediately associate with essentially launching such a profoundly important revolution. 

# Friday 2 May
 International solidarity conference, some good speeches. The kids dancing was cute but it was weird when they hugged us 

# Saturday 3 May 
The highlight of this day was definitely talking to the farmers and helping them out doing some weeding. It definitely didn’t feel like we were doing much to help them, but I hope that it did help. We learnt that the farms essentially run as coops, with most of the money being reinvested back into the farms, and with the workers voting on what the farm grows and how the farm operates. 

Because of the blockade, and the difficulty manufacturing or procuring chemical fertilisers and pesticides etc, the farm (and many other farms across Cuba) is organic by default. They mentioned that now they’ve learnt how to efficiently farm organically, they probably wouldn’t go back even when the resources eventually become available. 

# Sunday 4 May
Beach + departed to hotel. Beach was beautiful and amazing and it was great to eat a wider variety of food at the hotel. I got very burned though because I forgot to bring my water proof sun cream. 

# Monday 5 May
Today, we visited the Che Guevara mausoleum. It’s a very impressive monument to Che and the first time I’ve ever seen a figure like Che memorialised in such an impressive way - such a stark contrast to the types of people that we choose to memorialise in the UK. A power cut meant that we couldn’t enter the actual mausoleum part of the memorial, but we managed to do that later in the week. 

We then visited the Tren Blindado (armoured train), a train that was derailed by Che and his soldiers using a bulldozer. It contains a set of obelisks set at different angles to look like an explosion. An important capture because the train was sent to Batista to try turn around his regime’s position in the battles, so it contained ammunition and provisions, which Che and the guerrillas captured. 

On this day we also met with some inspirational combatants who had fought at the Bay of Pigs invasion, against the US’ attempt to overthrow the Cuban revolution. It was interesting to hear about their experiences and their passion for protecting the revolution and defending the Cuban people against US imperialism. 

# Tuesday 6 May

# Wednesday 7 May 
We met with various people from the National Programmes for the advancement of women, against racism and discrimination, and the body for Compliance with the children and youth code. 

A standout part of this was hearing just how committed Cuba is to ensuring women have every opportunity possible - and hearing about the vast numbers of female politicians and doctors in Cuba.


# Thursday 8 May
We didn’t do much today, we returned from the Santa Clara province to the CIJAM camp (five hour coach)

# Friday 9 May 
Today we visited biocubafarma facilities where they research, design, and manufacture vaccines and treatments for diseases. During COVID, The US’ illegal blockade meant that Cuba didn’t have access to the vaccines that other countries did, so they had to research and design their own vaccines to protect the Cuban population. Cuba successfully designed two vaccines and rolled them out across the country free of charge - with over 90% of their population choosing to receive the vaccine.
